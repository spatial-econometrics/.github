# Spatial Econometrics Association

This page is the Github organizational home of the [Spatial Econometrics Association](https://www.spatialeconometricsassociation.org/association/). 

During the discussion following the "Spatial Econometrics Software Roundtable" session held
at the [2023 Annual Meeting of the SEA](https://www.spatialeconometricsassociation.org/2023-annual-sea-conference-san-diego/), participants of the session agreed to start an organizational
account to provide a central platform and help organize activity among several open-source software projects for spatial econometric research. Following, the members of the roundtable, listed below,
agreed to participate in @spatial-econometrics as a way of sharing information related to new developments in spatial econometric software, computational estimation techniques, methodological advancements,
etc., as they relate to shared open-source efforts.

The spatial econometrics community continues to grow in size, scope, and diversity, but open-source software development is hard work.
Traditional silos in disciplines (e.g. economics vs geography) programming languages (e.g. Python vs R) and research foci (applied vs theoretical)
create additional burdens for community-building among a diverse set of scientists who nonetheless share common research interests. 
This account is intended to help share knowledge and centralize efforts across this wide group of community members. 
It serves as the interface between the Spatial Econometrics Association and the open-source software community.

We encourage you to open a [discussion](https://github.com/orgs/spatial-econometrics/discussions) with any questions, and we are always welcoming of new members and contributors
